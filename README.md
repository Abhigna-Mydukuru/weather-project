Weather Application

This is a dynamic and responsive weather application built with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3 that provides real-time weather information to users. The application fetches current weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions through API integration. Users have the flexibility to search for weather information by entering any city name, or they can allow the application to automatically detect their geolocation and display local weather conditions. The application features a fully responsive design that works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, ensuring an optimal user experience on any screen size.

The project is built using HTML5 with semantic markup and geolocation API support. JavaScript (ES6+) powers the core functionality through the Fetch API for retrieving weather data, comprehensive DOM manipulation for dynamic content updates, and event handling for user interactions. All weather information updates without requiring a page refresh through asynchronous operations. CSS3 is leveraged for modern styling techniques including Flexbox and Grid layouts for responsive design, smooth animations and transitions, gradient backgrounds, and media queries to ensure mobile compatibility.

To use the application, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. You can then allow location access for automatic weather detection or search for any city to view its current weather conditions. This project demonstrates proficiency in API integration, asynchronous programming, responsive web design, DOM manipulation, user geolocation services, and modern CSS styling techniques. The weather application showcases the ability to create functional, user-friendly web applications that solve real-world problems using core web technologies.
